## Issue #4053 Foyer Cache Benchmark

This section records the cache-backend benchmark used to validate replacing the
old SQLite file-content cache with the foyer hybrid cache.

**Command:**
```bash
cd nexus-fuse && cargo bench --bench cache_backends
```

**Environment:**
- Date: 2026-05-08 19:17:41 PDT
- OS: Darwin KWN9VC2WN4 25.3.0 arm64
- Rust: rustc 1.95.0 (59807616e 2026-04-14)
- Foyer: 0.22.3

**Benchmark setup:**
- Warm reads: 32 MiB foyer DRAM tier, 256 MiB filesystem tier
- Agent churn trace: 192 objects, 32-object hot set, 64 KiB/object, 2 MiB foyer DRAM tier, 256 MiB filesystem tier
- SQLite baseline: benchmark-only in-memory table with the same path/content/ETag shape
- No live Nexus server is required

The p99 values below are computed from Criterion's per-sample operation times
(`sample.json` sample time divided by sample iterations).

| Workload | Foyer mean | SQLite mean | Mean delta | Foyer p99 sample/op | SQLite p99 sample/op | p99 delta |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Warm read, 1 KiB | 215.6 ns | 1.09 us | 80.1% faster | 222.1 ns | 1.16 us | 80.8% faster |
| Warm read, 10 KiB | 325.9 ns | 1.54 us | 78.8% faster | 355.3 ns | 1.77 us | 80.0% faster |
| Warm read, 100 KiB | 2.27 us | 8.27 us | 72.6% faster | 3.14 us | 9.90 us | 68.3% faster |
| Warm read, 1 MiB | 21.65 us | 85.55 us | 74.7% faster | 45.87 us | 119.59 us | 61.6% faster |
| Agent churn trace | 27.43 us | 7.28 us | 276.7% slower | 34.01 us | 8.39 us | 305.4% slower |

Acceptance criterion met: the warm-read cache hot path shows at least 61.6%
p99 read-latency reduction versus the SQLite baseline, exceeding the 30%
target. The churn trace intentionally exceeds the foyer DRAM hot set and is
kept as visibility into filesystem-tier behavior; it is not the passing
criterion for this run.

Existing SQLite cache files under the nexus-fuse cache root are dropped on
cache startup, including legacy sanitized URL names like `http___host_2026.db`
and hash names like `nexus_HASH.db`. New foyer cache content is stored under a
sibling `nexus_HASH.foyer/` directory.

## Performance Factors

### Why Rust is Faster

1. **No GIL Contention**
   - Python: Single-threaded due to GIL
   - Rust: True multi-threading with tokio

2. **Native Async I/O**
   - Python: Blocking I/O with thread pools
   - Rust: Tokio async runtime (epoll/kqueue)

3. **Persistent Hybrid Cache**
   - Python: In-memory dict (process lifetime)
   - Rust: Foyer DRAM tier plus filesystem tier

4. **Zero-Copy Operations**
   - Python: Multiple object allocations per operation
   - Rust: Direct buffer operations, minimal allocations

5. **Compiled Code**
   - Python: Interpreted bytecode
   - Rust: Native machine code with LLVM optimizations

### Performance Degradation Scenarios

These scenarios may NOT see significant speedup:

1. **Context-Aware Operations**
   - Falls back to Python for permission checks
   - Namespace-scoped mounts use Python

2. **Virtual Views**
   - Parsed file content (`.md`, `.txt`) uses Python
   - View transformations require Python logic

3. **Network-Bound Operations**
   - When Nexus server is slow, client speed less important
   - Network latency dominates computation time

4. **First-Time Operations**
   - Cache warmup requires actual backend calls
   - No speedup until cache is populated

## Measurement Methodology

### Python Baseline

```bash
# Time full test suite
time uv run python nexus-fuse/test_mount_integration.py

# Extract individual operation times from logs
grep "✓" output.log | awk '{print $NF}'
```

### Rust Benchmarks

```bash
# Run full benchmark suite
cargo bench --bench fuse_operations

# Extract specific operation results
cargo bench read_1kb_cached -- --output-format bencher

# Compare with saved baseline
cargo bench -- --baseline python-equivalent
```

### Statistical Significance

- **Sample size**: 100 iterations (Criterion default)
- **Measurement time**: 10 seconds per benchmark
- **Confidence interval**: 95% (Criterion default)
- **Outlier detection**: Enabled (reject >5% deviation)

## CI/CD Performance Regression Detection

```yaml
# .github/workflows/perf.yml
- name: Run performance tests
  run: ./nexus-fuse/run-benchmarks.sh

- name: Fail on regression
  run: |
    # Fail if any operation is >10% slower
    cargo bench -- --baseline main | grep "Performance has regressed"
```

## How to Update This Document

**Status:** 🟡 Ready for measurement (benchmarks built, pending actual run)

## 2026-05-09 — Issue #4055 Hydration Benchmark

Setup: mockito local server, 50 small files of 256 bytes each, criterion `iter_custom` measuring wall time for sequential 50-file reads.

| Scenario | Median wall time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `cold_read_p50_no_hydration` | 90.1 ms | Cache cold, each read goes to mockito (~0 RTT on localhost) |
| `cold_read_p50_with_hydration` | 27.4 µs | Hydrate ran first (parallel admit, concurrency=8), then reads from foyer DRAM |

Speedup ratio under mockito: **~3,284x**.

Caveat: mockito has near-zero RTT, so the cold-cache scenario doesn't pay realistic network costs — its 90 ms is dominated by foyer's per-cache-open initialization overhead (new temp dir per iteration), not network latency. On a production backend with real network latency, the cold-read path would be even slower (serial HTTP round-trips at 10–100 ms each = 500 ms–5 s for 50 files), while hydration uses bounded-parallel fetches (concurrency=8) so its wall time scales much better. The ratio on a real backend is expected to be well above 3×.

**Environment:**
- Date: 2026-05-09
- OS: Darwin 25.3.0 arm64
- Rust: rustc 1.95.0
- Foyer: 0.22.3
- Criterion: 0.8, sample_size=20, measurement_time=8s

**Next Step:** Run `./nexus-fuse/run-benchmarks.sh` to populate actual results

## 2026-05-10 — Issue #4056 Concurrent-Read Throughput

Validates the migration from `reqwest::blocking` to async hyper/reqwest with
a shared connection pool. Acceptance criterion stated in the issue was
"≥2× concurrent-read throughput vs. current".

**Command:**
```bash
cd nexus-fuse && cargo bench --bench concurrent_read
```

**Setup:** Local multi-thread tokio HTTP/1.1 responder bound to 127.0.0.1.
Mockito was rejected for this comparison because it runs a `current_thread`
runtime that serializes accepts — that masks any client-side concurrency
win. The bench server returns a fixed JSON-RPC payload with
`Connection: keep-alive` so the pooled client can reuse sockets.

**Pre-PR baseline status (R7).** Earlier rounds replaced an inflated
"fresh-client-per-call" baseline with a shared-async-client +
shared-current-thread-runtime emulation of `reqwest::blocking`. Round 7
correctly pointed out that even that emulation is not faithful:
`reqwest::blocking::Client` actually owns a dedicated internal sync-
runtime thread and dispatches each request over an mpsc channel.
Rather than ship numbers built on an emulation the reviewer rejected,
this bench now reports only the post-#4056 client at varying caller
concurrency. A truly faithful comparison requires compiling against
the `blocking` feature, which this crate dropped as part of #4056 —
the comparison has to happen in a separate checkout of `develop`.

Post-#4056 pooled throughput against the bench server (arm64 / Darwin
25.3, after R9 fixed proper HTTP/1.1 framing — the earlier numbers
were inflated because the bench server responded per-`read()` syscall
instead of per-request, occasionally double-replying on bursts):

| Threads | pooled ops/s |
|---|---|
| 1  |  8 926 |
| 4  | 29 640 |
| 8  | 41 187 |
| 16 | 50 613 |
| 32 | 57 000 |

**Acceptance vs the issue's stated ≥2× bar:** *not met* on this
hardware against any of the baselines we attempted. Single-thread
throughput drops about 30% vs. a shared-runtime emulation (pre-PR
likely behaves similarly because the multi-thread runtime carries
more per-call overhead at one caller); concurrent throughput
recovers but the gap above pre-PR-style numbers is in the 5–15%
range, not the 2× the issue asked for. It is met (3.1×–5.6×) against the no-shared-pool
worst case, but that's not what the production code looked like.

**Why ship the migration anyway?** The throughput win was a misread of
where the pre-PR overhead actually was — `reqwest::blocking` does keep
a pooled hyper client internally, so the wire-level pool reuse was
already there. The real wins this PR locks in:

1. The daemon can drop `tokio::task::spawn_blocking` around every RPC
   handler and use the async client directly — fewer blocking-pool
   threads, no per-call context switch (a follow-up will land this
   refactor in `daemon.rs`).
2. Removes the `reqwest = { ..., features = ["blocking"] }` feature
   pull, simplifying the dependency surface.
3. Aligns with the rest of the Rust workspace, which is async-first.
4. Concurrent-read latency tail is shorter under the multi-thread
   runtime: pre-PR's current-thread runtime serializes polling, so
   when many FUSE workers contend, requests queue at the runtime; the
   multi-thread runtime parallelizes polling across workers.

The 2× claim in the issue acceptance criteria was authored before
anyone profiled the existing blocking client. It should be amended
to reflect the actual measurement, which is what this PR now reports.

**Environment:**
- Date: 2026-05-10
- OS: Darwin 25.3.0 arm64
- Rust: rustc 1.95.0
- reqwest: 0.13 (async, rustls)
- tokio: 1 (multi-thread, 2 worker threads in the shared HTTP runtime)

## Issue #4060: FUSE Passthrough Large Sequential Reads

Command:
```bash
dd if=/mnt/nexus/data/one-gib.bin of=/dev/null bs=8M status=progress
```

Opt-in Criterion harness:
```bash
NEXUS_FUSE_PASSTHROUGH_BENCH_FILE=/mnt/nexus/data/one-gib.bin \
  cargo bench --bench passthrough_read -- --sample-size 10
```

Acceptance target: at least 2x the normal userspace read path on a supported Linux 6.9+ environment.

Local non-Linux development note: passthrough throughput was not measured in this commit. The manual command is documented here, and Rust/Python coverage verifies eligibility, fallback, command construction, and the opt-in benchmark harness. The final PR should include Linux benchmark output from a host with FUSE passthrough enabled.
