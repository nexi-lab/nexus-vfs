//! Per-zone incremental-refresh checkpoint (Phase 5 of the Python-
//! parity roadmap; see `PARITY_ROADMAP.md`).
//!
//! # What this stores
//!
//! For every path the FTS + ANN indexes currently hold, we record
//! its `modified_at_ms` from the kernel at Index time.  On Refresh
//! the walker compares the current kernel mtime against this cache
//! and only re-indexes files that:
//!
//! - are NEW (in the walk but not the cache),
//! - have a NEWER mtime than the cache remembers (edited since
//!   last Index), or conversely
//! - are STALE — in the cache but missing from the current walk
//!   (deleted); those get dropped from both FTS + ANN.
//!
//! Files whose mtime matches the cache exactly are left alone —
//! the whole point of P5 is that a Refresh over a mostly-unchanged
//! corpus is O(walk + a couple of small file reads) rather than
//! O(full reindex).
//!
//! # SSOT + persistence posture
//!
//! Corpus SSOT stays the kernel VFS (per D1).  This cache is
//! **derived state** — dropping the file is always safe, the next
//! Refresh (or Index) rebuilds it.  Per-node, not replicated:
//! each node maintains its own indexes and its own cache; the
//! MetaStore isn't involved because the plugin doesn't currently
//! have a metastore callback in KernelHandle and adding one would
//! violate principle 1b (don't lightly modify kernel ABI).
//!
//! # File layout
//!
//! `<root>/<zone_id>/index_state.json` — a sibling of the `fts-v2/` +
//! `ann-*-v2/` directories under the per-zone root.  Atomic rewrite
//! via write-then-rename so a mid-write crash never leaves a
//! truncated file that would break the next open.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! `IndexState` is behind a `parking_lot::RwLock`.  Reads (Refresh
//! diff pass) take the read lock; writes (record after successful
//! per-file index) take the write lock briefly.  Save happens at
//! end-of-Refresh so the diff loop doesn't take a lock per file.
