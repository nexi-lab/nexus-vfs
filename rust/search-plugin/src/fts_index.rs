//! Per-zone tantivy full-text index (Phase 1 of the Python-parity
//! roadmap; see `PARITY_ROADMAP.md` D1).
//!
//! # Storage layout
//!
//! Each zone has its own tantivy directory rooted at
//! `~/.nexus/plugins/search/<zone_id>/fts-v2/`.  The directory is
//! plugin-owned, per-node, and NOT replicated — the SSOT for
//! "what belongs in the index" is the kernel VFS itself, and the
//! MetaStore `search.indexed_gen` sidecar (added in Phase 5)
//! records the last-indexed generation so any node can drop-and-
//! rebuild without losing correctness anchors.  Dropping the
//! directory is always safe — the next Index or Query call
//! transparently recreates it.
//!
//! # Schema (P1)
//!
//! ```text
//! path         STRING | STORED   exact match + retrievable
//! chunk_index  I64    | STORED   integer, 0 in P1 (one chunk per file)
//! chunk_text   TEXT(en_stem) | STORED   BM25-analysed, English-stemmed
//! mtime_ms     I64    | STORED   millisecond-resolution mtime
//! ```
//!
//! `chunk_text` runs through tantivy's built-in `en_stem` analyzer
//! (simple tokenizer + lowercase + English Porter stemmer) so
//! morphological query variants match — `authorization` finds
//! "authorized", matching the pre-P12 Postgres FTS behaviour that
//! stemmed both sides (#4618).  The query parser resolves the same
//! analyzer from the field config, so index and query time agree.
//! This is an index-schema property: indices built with the
//! pre-stemmer schema live under the old `fts/` directory and the
//! manager opens `fts-v2/` instead — rebuild to populate.
//!
//! `mtime_ms` is STORED only in P1 (no INDEXED).  P6 flips it to
//! `STORED | INDEXED` when recency queries land; INDEXED today would
//! build a range index nothing queries.  P4 grows `chunk_index` to
//! a real value once the chunker lands; P2 adds a `vec_id` field
//! pointing at the sibling HNSW index.
//!
//! # Idempotency
//!
//! [`add_document`](FtsIndex::add_document) first deletes any prior
//! document with the same `path` (P1 = one chunk per file, so path
//! IS the primary key).  Re-indexing the same file replaces its
//! document instead of duplicating it — Index calls are safe to
//! retry.  P4 grows the key to `(path, chunk_index)` when the
//! chunker emits multiple chunks per file.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! `tantivy::IndexWriter` allows one writer per index at a time.  We
//! wrap it in a `parking_lot::Mutex`; add_document + commit are
//! millisecond-scale and the mutex is not held across await points,
//! so contention is negligible even under concurrent Index calls
//! for different paths in the same zone.
//!
//! Readers are cheap — tantivy's `IndexReader` snapshots the last
//! committed generation and is `Send + Sync`.  The `search` path
//! takes no locks.
//!
//! # Writer liveness (#4725)
//!
//! tantivy's `commit()` joins and respawns every indexing worker
//! thread.  When the OS refuses a thread mid-respawn (`pids.max`
//! exhausted ⇒ EAGAIN) the writer can be left with NO workers, and its
//! next `commit()` quietly recreates a live document channel: from
//! then on `add_document` buffers into a channel nobody drains, every
//! commit discards the buffer and still succeeds, and the plugin
//! acknowledges writes that never become searchable.  That was the
//! 26-hour silent-loss window in #4725.  Two guards close it:
//!
//! - **Commit probe.**  Each transaction remembers the last path it
//!   added; after the commit + reload that path must resolve via the
//!   exact-match `path` term.  If it does not, the commit is reported
//!   as [`IndexError::LostWrite`] — the caller never records state or
//!   returns a success count for it.
//! - **Rebuild on fault.**  A failed commit or a failed probe drops
//!   the writer and reopens it.  If the reopen fails too (still under
//!   thread pressure) the slot stays empty and every mutation fails
//!   loudly until a later reopen succeeds.
//!
//! [`FtsIndex::writer_status`] exposes the fault for the Health RPC so
//! a poller cannot read `healthy` while the writer is dead.
