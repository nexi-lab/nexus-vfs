//! Per-zone [`FtsIndex`] cache with lazy open-or-create (Phase 1 of
//! the Python-parity roadmap; see `PARITY_ROADMAP.md` D1).
//!
//! # Rationale
//!
//! `FtsIndex` is the storage primitive — one directory, one schema,
//! one writer lock.  `IndexManager` is the zone router — it maps
//! `zone_id -> Arc<FtsIndex>` and lazily opens an index the first
//! time a Query or Index call names a zone the manager hasn't seen
//! yet.  Separating the two keeps `service.rs` free of directory
//! plumbing: the RPC handler asks the manager for an index and
//! calls into it.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! The cache is a `parking_lot::Mutex<HashMap<zone_id, Arc<FtsIndex>>>`;
//! the lock is held for a hash lookup (typically ns) or a first-boot
//! `open_or_create` (typically low-ms once per zone).  A `DashMap`
//! would be lower-overhead in principle but zone count is small
//! (single-digit typical, tens max) and Query lookups take zero
//! locks after the first-boot cost — the `Arc<FtsIndex>` is cloned
//! out under the lock and the rest of the request runs lock-free.
//!
//! # Storage roots
//!
//! The directory layout is `<root>/<zone_id>/fts-v2/`.  Root resolves
//! from the `NEXUS_DATA_DIR` env var (same convention as
//! [`nexus-vault`]'s per-node state), falling back to `./nexus-data`
//! when unset — one SSOT lets operators relocate ALL plugins by
//! pointing `NEXUS_DATA_DIR` at a data volume.  Tests pass an
//! explicit tempdir via [`IndexManager::with_root`].
//!
//! Zone-id sanitisation is minimal — the caller (the kernel-tier
//! RPC handler) never lets a client-controlled string reach this
//! API; `zone_id` values are drawn from the raft-managed zone
//! registry.
//!
//! [`nexus-vault`]: ../../../vault/src/lib.rs
