//! `lib` — portable Rust lib for Nexus.
//!
//! This crate contains WASM-safe computation extracted from `kernel`.
//! It compiles to `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and has zero CPython (PyO3) dependency.
//!
//! Modules:
//! - `types` — domain types (Entity, Permission, etc.)
//! - `rebac` — Relationship-Based Access Control engine
//! - `search` — line-oriented text search (literal + regex)
//! - `bloom` — Bloom filter for fast set-membership checks
//! - `hash` — BLAKE3 content hashing
//! - `glob` — Glob pattern matching
//! - `bitmap` — Roaring Bitmap operations
//! - `transport_primitives` — gRPC TLS / pool / addressing / TOFU trust
//!   store / `PeerBlobClient` trait. Behind the `transport` feature;
//!   brings tonic + tokio-light deps that pure-algo callers (WASM, edge
//!   profile) can skip.

// PyO3 wrappers around the algorithms above. Compiled only when the
// `python` feature is on (kernel cdylib is the sole consumer today).
// Pure-Rust algorithm files remain WASM-clean.
