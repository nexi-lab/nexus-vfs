//! `services` — kernel-adjacent service-tier impls (parallel-layers crate).
//!
//! Per `docs/architecture/KERNEL-ARCHITECTURE.md` §1, services sit
//! parallel to the kernel: they consume kernel primitives (syscalls,
//! `NativeInterceptHook`, `PathResolver`, `ServiceRegistry`) without
//! adding new kernel surface.  The line between "kernel primitive"
//! (lives in `kernel/src/core/`) and "service" (lives here) is whether
//! the code is part of the syscall path itself (kernel) or layered on
//! top of it (service).
//!
//! Module layout:
//!
//! ```text
//! services/
//!   acp/             — Rust-port of nexus.services.acp (subprocess +
//!                      ACP-over-stdio for AgentKind::UNMANAGED agents)
//!   agents/          — agent table + procfs-style status resolver
//!   audit/           — AuditHook (NativeInterceptHook) + factory
//!   managed_agent/   — ManagedAgentService (mailbox + workspace hooks
//!                      plus session lifecycle for AgentKind::MANAGED)
//!   permission/      — PermissionHook scaffolding (§11; dead today)
//!   python/          — `#[cfg(feature = "python")]` PyO3 sub-module
//! ```
//!
//! ## Hard invariant: `services` ⊥ `backends`
//!
//! `services` MUST NOT depend on `backends` — the two are co-equal
//! peers under `kernel`, and any service that needs backend behaviour
//! must reach it through `kernel.sys_*` syscalls (the same path
//! Python takes).  Cargo enforces this at the workspace level:
//! [`services/Cargo.toml`] does NOT list `backends` as a dependency.
//! A future CI lint can grep for `use backends` inside this crate to
//! catch accidental violations.
//!
//! Direction summary:
//!
//! ```text
//!   contracts <- lib <- kernel <- services    (one-way; no cycle)
//!                          ^
//!                          +--- backends     (peer; never crosses to services)
//! ```
