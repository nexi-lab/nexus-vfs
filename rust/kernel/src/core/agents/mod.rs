//! Kernel agent registry — per-PID agent SSOT.
//!
//! [`registry::AgentRegistry`] holds the per-PID agent descriptors
//! (name, kind, state, owner) that the kernel mutates on agent
//! lifecycle events. DashMap-backed, no I/O, shared across syscall
//! threads via `Arc`, and read by service-tier views like
//! `services::agents::status_resolver::AgentStatusResolver`.
//!
//! Linux analogue: this is the kernel-owned `task_struct` ↔ pid_hash
//! pairing.  Kernel constructs + mutates the registry; service-tier
//! procfs views (`fs/proc/`) read it through shared references.
//!
//! Kernel owns the data; services owns the views (preserves the
//! one-way `services -> kernel` dependency).
