//! DriverLifecycleCoordinator — kernel-internal mount lifecycle primitive.
//!
//! Linux analogue: `register_filesystem()` + `kern_mount()` + `kill_sb()`.
//!
//! Pure kernel internal — zero `#[pymethods]`. Python callers go through
//! `Kernel::sys_setattr(DT_MOUNT)` (codegen ABI). Rust callers (factory,
//! zone_manager) will call DLC directly when Rust-ified.
//!
//! Responsibilities:
//!   1. Add/remove backend in kernel VFSRouter via `Kernel::add_mount`
//!   2. Write DT_MOUNT metadata to per-mount metastore
//!   3. Populate dcache with mount point entry
//!   4. Upgrade LockManager to distributed for root zone federation mounts
//!
//! DLC owns no mount table of its own — `VFSRouter::entries` is the SSOT
//! for "what mounts exist".  Querying mount existence goes through
//! `Kernel::has_mount` (which delegates to the router); listing mount
//! points goes through `Kernel::get_mount_points`.
