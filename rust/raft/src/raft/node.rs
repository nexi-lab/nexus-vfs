//! Raft node implementation — channel/actor pattern (etcd/tikv style).
//!
//! # Architecture: Single-Owner Actor Pattern
//!
//! raft-rs's `RawNode` is **NOT** thread-safe. All mutating operations (step,
//! propose, tick, ready, advance) must happen sequentially from a single owner.
//! This is the same contract as etcd (single goroutine) and tikv (PeerFsmDelegate).
//!
//! We enforce this at **compile time** by splitting into two types:
//!
//! - [`ZoneConsensus`] — the public **handle** (Clone + Send + Sync). External code
//!   (gRPC handlers, kernel internals, tests) uses this. All mutating operations go through
//!   an `mpsc` channel to the driver.
//!
//! - [`ZoneConsensusDriver`] — the private **actor** that exclusively owns `RawNode`.
//!   Only the transport loop's single task may call its methods. `RawNode` is a
//!   private field that cannot be accessed from outside this module.

//! # INVARIANT
//!
//! **`RawNode` must NEVER be exposed outside `ZoneConsensusDriver`.** Do not add
//! `pub` to `raw_node`, do not return references to it, do not create methods
//! that bypass the channel. Violating this invariant causes the
//! `"not leader but has new msg after advance"` panic under concurrent load.
