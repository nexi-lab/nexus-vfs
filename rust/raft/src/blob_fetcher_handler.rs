//! KernelBlobFetcher — server-side handler for the driver-to-driver
//! `ReadBlob` RPC, co-located with `ZoneApiService` on the raft port.
//!
//! Lives in the raft crate alongside the `BlobFetcher` trait + the
//! gRPC server: raft owns the wire-format and dispatch fabric, kernel
//! owns the data plane (mount backends). This handler bridges the two
//! by reaching kernel-side state (`VFSRouter`) through the kernel's
//! syscall surface — no ``MetaStore`` Arc leaks across the crate
//! boundary.
//!
//! Store-and-forward: ``content_id`` is opaque. The fetcher resolves
//! it via the local ``VFSRouter`` — for federation reads ``content_id``
//! is a global VFS path, the router picks the matching mount, and the
//! mount's backend interprets the locally-stored
//! ``FileMetadata.content_id`` (hash for CAS, backend_path for PAS).
//! The kernel never inspects the string.
//!
//! Installation: `Kernel::wire_blob_fetcher` (called from
//! `init_federation_from_env` once the ZoneManager is up) takes the
//! slot handed back by `ZoneManager::blob_fetcher_slot()` and writes
//! `Arc<KernelBlobFetcher>` into it. From then on, peer `ReadBlob`
//! requests resolve against the local data plane.
